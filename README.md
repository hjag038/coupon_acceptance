Findings/Hypothesis:Â 

Bar related coupon analysis:

* Drivers who frequent bars more often and are within a certain age range (specifically under 30 based on our analysis) are more likely to accept bar coupons. 
* The presence of certain passengers (not kids) and specific occupations might also influence acceptance, but the frequency of bar visits and age seem to be more strongly correlated based on our analysis.

CoffeeHouse related coupon analysis:
* Drivers who visit coffeehouses more frequently are more likely to accept coffeehouse coupons, with those going more than once a month showing a particularly higher acceptance rate.
* The presence of passengers who are not kids also seems to have a positive influence on acceptance.
* Drivers who went to Coffee Houses more than once a month and were under the age of 30 had a pretty high acceptance rate.

Conclusion:

Users aged below 21 were most likely to accept the coupon and we can target this specific age group with a higher chance of acceptance for both Bar and CoffeeHouse related coupons.
